                <p>
                    I am an aspiring full stack web developer. Though I did not study computer science in university (I went for geology instead), I did take a few brogramming courses and worked as a hobbyist on a few projects of my own. Though I never released anything publicly, I did learn the basics of software design and discovered an interest that I hope to turn into a career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently reside in Anchorage, Alaska, USA. On my off time, I enjoy video gaming, rock collecting, and hiking.
